# How it works

`deloominator` detects a chart based on the following characteristics of the data
set:

- The number of columns returned
- The type of columns and their order

For example, let's consider the following data set:

| country | total |
|---------|-------|
| A       | 10    |
| B       | 42    |
| C       | 24    |

It has *2* columns and the sequence of types is:

- `Text` - `Number`

In such a case, `deloominator` renders a [Simple Bar](#simple-bar).

# Supported charts

Here is a list of the charts `deloominator` detects automatically. They're
organized by the number of columns in the data set. Each chart comes with an
example query that is based on the [Sakila Sample
Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/).

## Two-column charts

### Simple Bar

One of the following type sequences:

- `Text` - `Number`
- `Number` - `Number`

Example:

```sql
SELECT rating, count(*) total FROM film GROUP BY 1
```

### Simple Line

Type sequence:

- `Time` - `Number`

Example:

```sql
SELECT last_update , count(*) total FROM film group by 1
```

## Three-column charts

### Grouped Bar

Type sequences:

- `Text` - `Text` - `Number`

Example:

```sql
SELECT rating, c.name, count(*) FROM film f
INNER JOIN film_category fc ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
INNER JOIN category c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
```

### Multi Line

Type sequence:

- `Time` - `Text` - `Number`

Example:

```sql
SELECT f.last_update, c.name, count(*) FROM film f
INNER JOIN film_category fc ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
INNER JOIN category c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Sci-Fi', 'Drama', 'Travel', 'Documentary')
GROUP BY 1, 2
```
